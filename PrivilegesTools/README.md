# PrivilegesTools
A couple bits for making [Privileges.app](https://github.com/SAP/macOS-enterprise-privileges) work for you.

`AddUsertoPrivilegesGroup` - Simple script to add local user to pre-defined [Privileges.app](https://github.com/SAP/macOS-enterprise-privileges)-enabled group

`RevokePrivileges` - A LaunchDaemon, a LaunchAgent, and a small bash script that keeps an eye on the membership of `. /groups/admin`.
